#### Short(est) answer: A data scientist does "[models](#what-are-models)"
Of course, to answer this centuries old (the title was coined in 2008) question, we need more explanation. 
First, let's outline the core responsibilities of a data scientist:
1. [Designing](#model-design) models which could help in making better and/or faster decisions
    * Models built on or backed by <b>data</b>
2. Automating the [parameters estimation](#parameters-estimation) for the models
3. Making sure the [models can be updated](#updating-model), with new information, in the fastest; most friction-less way possible
4. [Explaining](#explaining-model); or building tools which could explain the models (or models output)
5. Building [monitoring](#monitoring-model) tools which could assist in improving/controlling the models output

## What are models
A model is a “representation” (or simplification) of a physical object; a process; a system; or a phenomenon. 
A representation is by definition not accurate, therefore, we have the aphorism:
>All models are wrong, but some are useful.

The <b>usefulness</b> of a model depends on the design; parameters; complexity; and assumptions made for the model. In different contexts/scenarios a model can become more or less useful.

### Model Design
Let's take the example of a forecasting model. [TODO]

### Parameters Estimation
For our forecasting model the parameters are... [TODO]

### Updating Model
Every model expires... [TODO]

### Explaining Model
Sometimes explaing the model (or model output) is more important than model accuracy... [TODO]

### Monitoring Model
To make sure... [TODO]
