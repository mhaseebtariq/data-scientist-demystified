#### Short(est) answer: A data scientist does "models"
Of course, to answer this centuries old (the title was coined in 2008) question, we need more explanation. 
First, let's outline the core responsibilities of a data scientist:
1. Designing models which could help in making better or faster decisions
    * Models built on or backed by <b>data</b>
2. Automating the parameters estimation for the models
3. Making sure the models can be updated, with new information, in the fastest; most frictionless way possible
4. Explaining; or building tools which could explain the models (or models output)
5. Building monitoring tools which could assist in improving/controlling the models output

#### What are models
A model is a “representation” (or simplification) of a physical object; a process; a system; or a phenomenon. 
A representation is by definition not accurate, therefore, we have the aphorism:
>All models are wrong, but some are useful.

The <b>usefulness</b> of a model depends on the design; parameters; complexity; and assumptions made for the model.
