What the data scientist do?

Short(est) answer: A data scientist does "models". 
Of course, to answer this centuries old (the title was coined in 2008) question, we need more explanation. 
Let's try to first outline the core responsibilities, and then we will try to elaborate on each role.

1. Designing models which could help in making better decisions.
2. Automating the parameters estimation for the model.
3. Making sure the model can be updated, with new information, in the fastest; most frictionless way possible.
4. Explaining; or building tools which could explain the model.
5. Building monitoring tools which could assist in improving/controlling the model output.

We have to understand what “models” are, first. 
A model is a “representation” of a physical object; a process; a system; or a phenomenon. 
A representation is by definition not accurate, therefore, we have the expression: “every model is wrong...but some are useful”. 
The usefulness of the model depends on the parameters; complexity; design; and assumptions made for the said model.
